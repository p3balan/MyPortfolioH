                    <h2>My Life:</h2>
                    
                    <p> My name is Pranav Balan and a student at Franklin Central High School. I am 17 years old and I love to
                        play basketball and Xbox. I am a heavy eater but none of it actually affects me. My favorite foods
                        are pizza, burritos and all types of Indian food. I love to talk to people and make friends. I also
                        love to be outside, especially in the summer. Going to the pool, amusement parks and also to the
                        beach are my favorite parts of summer, and yes summer is my favorite season.
                    </p>

                    <h3>My Hobbies:</h3>
                    <p>My favorite sport is basketball as you read above and I play at least once a day on my hoop at home.
                        I usually 1v1 my brother in a game. When there are other people play at our hoop we play horse, around-the-world,
                        or just a game. I also love to play Xbox in my freetime. I play online with my friends most of the
                        times and right now I am very addicted to Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege and Destiny 2. Fortnite
                        is also a game I play which is really popular right now, but thats is when I am burned off the other
                        games. Xbox for me is only fun with my friends and that is only when I play. </p>

                    <h4>My Goals:</h4>
                    <p>My goals after passing high school are first off going to college. My dream college is Purdue and I am
                        trying my best to be eligible to go there. I am going to enlist in the Air Force and hope I get a
                        good position to server the country. I want to make my parents proud of my achievements and be known
                        in this world.</p>
